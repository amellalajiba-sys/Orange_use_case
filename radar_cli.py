radar_cli.py  (renamed from tools.py)
======================================

Single entry point for every one-off Innovation Radar pipeline tool.

Run:
    python radar_cli.py all [--force]        # runs the entire pipeline in order, one command
    python radar_cli.py create [--wipe]     # register CANDIDATES (pipeline/config.py) as opportunity spaces
    python radar_cli.py delete OS001 OS024  # permanently delete specific opportunity spaces (asks to confirm)
    python radar_cli.py promote             # auto-register recurring themes that hit the promotion threshold
    python radar_cli.py calibrate           # signal counts / source diversity, for tuning scoring.py's caps
    python radar_cli.py dedupe [--apply]    # find/remove near-duplicate signals (dry-run by default)
    python radar_cli.py watchlist           # show out-of-taxonomy terms + recurring themes, read-only
    python radar_cli.py link                # link the strongest real signals to each opportunity space
    python radar_cli.py themes              # regenerate candidate_opportunity_spaces.md, unfiltered
    python radar_cli.py scores              # print latest scores to console
    python radar_cli.py summary             # write opportunity_spaces_summary.md -- the file to bring to a meeting

WHAT CHANGED
- `create` now warns (doesn't block) when the vertical+use_case+technology
  triple you're about to register already exists under a different label --
  the exact class of bug behind the OS001/OS013 duplicate. Adapted from a
  teammate's duplicate-check idea; reimplemented as a parameterized query
  (db.find_opportunity_space_by_triple) instead of an f-string-built SQL
  query, since the original interpolated vertical/use_case/technology
  straight into the SQL text.
- `discover` (which read emerging_themes.json) is GONE. Replaced by
  `promote`, which reads pipeline/db.py's recurring_themes table directly
  -- no JSON file involved anywhere anymore. This is also the mechanism
  that grows the opportunity space list past a fixed, hand-picked 15 (see
  pipeline/config.py's CANDIDATES docstring).
- `watchlist` is a new read-only command to see what's pending/promotable
  in both watchlist_terms (out-of-taxonomy single terms) and
  recurring_themes (recurring valid themes) without re-running analyze.py.
